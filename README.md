# Official Implementation of _Delta Green: The Role-Playing Game_ System for Foundry Virtual Tabletop

Officially supported rules implementation (system) for [Foundry Virtual Tabletop](https://foundryvtt.com/) system for Delta Green: The Role-Playing Game, based on the _Agent's Handbook_ rule set from Arc Dream Publishing (_**not** the Call of Cthulu rules_).

Published by Arc Dream Publishing by arrangement with the Delta Green Partnership. The intellectual property known as Delta Green is a trademark and copyright owned by the Delta Green Parternship, who has licensed its use here.

# System Overview

Whatever system documentation currently exists can be found [here.](https://github.com/TheLastScrub/delta-green-foundry-vtt-system/blob/master/documentation/home.md)

_NOTE_ - There is a system setting that controls the styling of the sheets. The current default is "Program" which gives a more modern look. To look more like the way the system looked prior to v1.3.0, choose the 'Cowboys' option.

See samples of all tabs in the main agent character sheet [here](./documentation/agent_sheet_sample.md).

![Character Sheet Skills Section Screenshot](./documentation/images/agent_sheet_program_skills_tab.webp)

The system automates most of the calculations on the sheet such as maximum HP/WP/SAN. Recalculating break points can be done by clicking a button. Clicking on labels for skills, sanity, x5 skill tests or weapon damage/lethality will automatically roll those tests or damage.

Likewise, right-clicking or shift-clicking on a field will bring up a dialogue to modify that roll (default: +20).

There is a compendium with numerous sample agents (parsed from the work of _jets_or_chasm_ and _morlock_) of all the professions to get players started quickly if they do not wish to build an Agent themselves, or quickly need a replacement:

There are also some compendiums currently available with some of the more commonly used items that can be dragged directly onto a character sheet (and then modified as necessary).
